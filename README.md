# Gym Buddy reborn

What started as my first independent full stack project is getting a reboot for mobile.`

The intent remains the same - build a gym app that allows for trackigong of exercise metrics in an intuitive and straitforward manner.

A mobile application has far more useability - most people take their phone to the gym, and those who track their metrics likely do this on-the-go, using their mobile.

Flutter will be used for the client-side of the app, with Go hosting a simple backend that will alow for saving workouts and progress.
